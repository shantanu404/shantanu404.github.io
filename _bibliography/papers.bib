abstract={Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) have the potential to provide a reliable and cost-effective source of power by combining multiple sources of renewable energy. In this study, a techno-economic analysis of an HRES is conducted in Lalmonirhat, Bangladesh using load data from the Northern Electricity Supply Company (NESCO). Two population-based optimization algorithms, particle swarm optimization(PSO) and Harris Hawk Optimization(HHO), are utilized to find the optimal combination of renewable energy sources, which includes PV, wind turbine and biogas plants. According to findings of the study, an optimized HRES has the potential to provide a cost-effective and reliable source of power for Lalmonirhat. The results show that incorporating renewable energy system into the grid can reduce the cost of electricity (COE) from 6.34 BDT/kWh to 4.174 BDT/kWh. The renewable energy sources generate 62.33% of the total load demand of the model area considered in the study. The implementation of an HRES in Lalmonirhat could significantly reduce the district’s reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to the country’s renewable energy goals. Our findings may be of interest to policymakers and energy practitioners seeking to transition to more sustainable energy systems.},

  abstract={Collision-free path planning is the most crucial component in multi-UAV formation-flying (MFF). We use unlabeled homogenous quadcopters (UAVs) to demonstrate the use of a flow network to create complete (inter-UAV) collision-free paths. This procedure has three main parts: 1) Creating a flow network graph from physical GPS coordinates, 2) Finding a path of minimum cost (least distance) using any graph-based path-finding algorithm, and 3) Implementing the Ford-Fulkerson Method to find the paths with the maximum flow (no collision). Simulations of up to 64 UAVs were conducted for various formations, followed by a practical experiment with 3 quadcopters for testing physical plausibility and feasibility. The results of these tests show the efficacy of this method's ability to produce safe, collision-free paths.},
