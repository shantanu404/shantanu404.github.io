I am an Embedded Systems Engineer at [TherapBD Ltd](https://therapbd.com). I work with the Computer Vision Team to assist them in running computer vision models on Edge IoT devices. In addition, I am working as a researcher in [Independent University of Bangladesh](https://iub.ac.bd). I graduated Summa Cum Laude (3.88/4.00, Rank: 13<sup>th</sup>) from [Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu) in July, 2024. My undergraduate thesis was under the supervsion of [Dr. Golam Sarowar](https://eee.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/asim/education).

My research interest lies on an wide array of fields including computer scince, control theory, machine learning, and robotics, with focus on motion-planning, multi-agent systems, computer vision, edge AI, and IoT. My research focuses on the reliablity and architecture of such systems.

A small but significant of my undergraduate activities were devoted to development of a autonomous rover system for environmental data collection. The system includes but not limited to a functioning locomotive body with an attached general purpose arm. This was a community driven project under the name of [Project Altair](https://www.altairrover.com) where I assumed the role of Team Lead for a year ('23-'24). During this time, we attended several competitions in Poland ([European Rover Challenge](https://roverchallenge.eu)) and India ([International Rover Challenge](https://roverchallenge.org/irc)), competiting against similar such rover system development teams. As one of the founding members of the project I was heavily involved in the Software Subteam and Electrical Subteam to lead the development in both highlevel software development (C++/Python) and low level embedded software-hardware integration (Arduino/Esp32). My work focused on design, control and operation system, communication and overall testing of the autonomous system. I was also part of the software team of [ANTS BD Ltd](https://antsbd.com), where we worked on developing a multi-UAV flight control system.
